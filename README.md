# Google Hash Code 2020


Hash Code is a team programming competition, organized by Google, for students and professionals around the world. The official link is [this](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/hashcode). I participated in the online qualification round of hash code 2020 and I think the question is quite interesting. I put my solution here. If you have better ideas, please let me know. 

Here are my ideas for these problem.
1.  First problem is quite easy and we can easily found a solution that all valuable books can be shipped. And the final score is 21=1+2+3+4+5+6.
2.  Second problem is not too difficult, we can observe that all libraries have 1000 books and can only send 1 book per day. All books have the same value,100. What is more important, every book exists in only one library. Considering that all librarys can not send over books, So the answer is clearly, we only need to continually select the library whose sign up days is shortest.
